_(This are my notes taken from the book Spring in Action 5th Edition)_

## Spring parts
* `Spring core` Provides the core container, dependency injection framework, Spring MVC (Rest APIs), Spring's web framework and support for template-based JDBC and reactive programming with Spring WebFlux.  
* `Spring boot` Starter dependencies and autoconfiguration.
* `Spring data` Provides the ability to define your application's data repository as Java interfaces. Works with relational (JPA), document (Mongo) and graph (Neo4j) databases.
* `Spring security` Authentication, authorization and API security.
* `Spring integration & Batch` helps integrate with other applications
* `Spring cloud` helps with microservices

## Project structure
    src/main/java
      ApplicationStarter.java

    src/test/java
      ApplicationStarterTest.java

    src/main/resources
      static
      templates
      application.properties
      schema.sql  
      data.sql

    mvnw.cmd
    pom.xml

* `mvnw.cmd` maven wrapper scripts. Used to build the project even without maven installed on your computer
* `static` folder to place images, stylesheets, js resources to serve to the browser
* `templates` folder to place template files that will be used to render content to the browser  
* `schema.sql` & `data.sql` they will be executed on start. Useful to create the structure of databases and fill them with data.

## Main's config
`@SpringBootApplication` is used at the main jar's Starter as in
~~~ java
@SpringBootApplication
public class ApplicationStarter {
    // main
}
~~~

It's a composition Tag which contains another three
* `@SpringBootConfiguration` Designates the class as a configuration one. is a specialized form of `@Configuration`
* `@EnableAutoConfiguration` Enables Spring to auto-configure any components that it thinks you may need
* `@ComponentScan` It lets you use another annotations such as `@Component` to declare Beans

## Web requests
The basic structure is an application which will be started with the embedded tomcat. A controller marked with `@Controller` tag and a `@GetMapping("/")` tag, which returns the name of the _Thymeleaf_ view to give to the browser.  

Controller class. It handles HTTP Requests and either gives it to a view to return HTML or writes data directly to the body (RESTful)  

### basic controller
~~~java
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/design")
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String home() {
        return "home"; // view name
    }

}
~~~

Thymeleaf will automatically search for `/templates/home.html` and return it as the view if it exists.

### view controller
For a `@Controller` which is used just to redirect a _path_ to a _view_ and it doesn't adds any kind of input to the Model, we may implement it with just a single a line at a `WebConfig` file.  
The example implemented on top would be better as the following
~~~ java
@Configuration
public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfig {

  @Override
  public void addViewControllers(final
            ViewControllerRegistry registry) {
    registry.addViewController("/")
            .setViewName("home");
  }

}
~~~

### request mapping tags
* `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)` general tag prior to Spring 4.3
* `@GetMapping` handles `HTTP GET` request
* `@PostMapping` handles `HTTP POST` request
* `@PutMapping` handles ...
* `@DeleteMapping`
* `@PatchMapping`

### thymeleaf
_(See thymeleaf notes)_

## Full Validation Example
Java's validation API works with Spring and Hibernate, this last adds a bunch of annotations to use and may work together between Model, View and Controller.

### declare validation rules
This is done at the model.
~~~ java
@Data
public class Taco {

  @NotNull
  @Size(min=5,
        message="must be at least 5 chars long")
  private String name;

  @Size(min=1,
        message="must choose at least 1 ing")
  private List<String> ingredients;

}
~~~

We also have other tags such as
~~~ java
@NotBlank(message="name is required")
private String name;

@CreditCardNumber(message="card not valid")
private String ccNumber;

@Pattern(regexp="here comes the regex",
         message="must be MM/YY")
private String ccExpiration;

@Digits(integer=3, fraction=0,
        message="invalid CVV")
private String ccCVV;
~~~

### activate validation
This is done at the controller w. `@Valid`.
~~~ java
@PostMapping
public String process(@Valid
@ModelAttribute("design") final Taco design,
                          final Errors errors)
{
  if(errors.hasErrors()) {
    return "design";
  }
  // do something
  return "viewX";
}
~~~
If an error is found, the details of this error will be loaded into the `Errors` object

### access the errors
This is done at the view.
~~~ html
<form method="POST" th:object="${design}">

<div th:if="${#fields.hasErrors()}">
    <p class="validationError">
      Please, correct following problems
    </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>Name your Taco creation:</h3>

  <span class="validationError"
        th:if="${#fields.hasErrors('name')}"
        th:errors="*{name}">Placeholder</span>
  <br/>
  <input type="text" th:field="*{name}"/>

  <button>Submit your taco</button>
</div>
</form>
~~~

### all broken together
1. The tags `@NotNull` declare what's wrong and when an Error should be thrown.  
2. At the controller with the line `@Valid @ModelAttribute("design") final Taco design` we declare what the model is and we assign it an `id = design`.  
3. At the view form:
* we access this model with `th:object="${design}"`
* we check if the form has any error(s) with `th:if="${#fields.hasErrors()}"` to show a general error
* we check a specific field with `th:if="${#fields.hasErrors('name')}"` and access the error message with `th:errors="*{name}"` to overwrite the placeholder.  
  This `name` is a field of the model we gave. At this example `Taco` has a `private String name` field which is the one we're checking here.

  ## Store Model attributes in a HTTP session (cache)
  This is used to store values which have to be used in between requests.  

  The `@SessionAttributes` is used in a `@Controller` class and whose value matches the one in `@ModelAttribute`.  
  When a request comes in it checks if there's an existing value in the HTTP session, if it does, it retrieves it directly without calling the method again.  

  ~~~ java
  @Controller
  @RequestMapping("/design")
  @SessionAttributes("ingredients")
  public class Controller {

    @ModelAttribute("ingredients")
    public List<Ingredient> addIng(final Model model) {
      final List<Ingredient> ings = // ...
      // first time this will be executed
      // second time it will retrieve the value from the cache
      return ings;
    }

  }
  ~~~  

## Databases
### JDBC (Java DataBase Connection)  
_(This is the old way without Spring JPA. Do not implement this)._  

Its support is rooted at `JdbcTemplate.java`. It provides a mean for developers to perform SQL operations against a relation database without _that much_ boilerplate code.

#### Working with JdbcTemplate
Dependencies to add:
~~~ xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>
    spring-boot-starter-jdbc
  </artifactId>
</dependency>
~~~

For every Bean to support, we should have an interface and an implementation of it, which will delegate all the operations to JDBC.  

~~~ java
public interface TacoRepository {

  public Taco save(final Taco taco);

}
~~~

~~~ java
@Repository
public class JdbcTacoRepository
  implements TacoRepository {

    @Autowired
    private final JdbcTemplate jdbc;  

    @Override
    public Taco save(final Taco taco) {

      // ...

      final PreparedStatementCreator psc = new
        PreparedStatementCreatorFactory(
          "insert into Taco (name, createdAt)
          values (?, ?)",
          Types.VARCHAR, Types.TIMESTAMP
        ).newPreparedStatementCreator(
        Arrays.asList(taco.getName(),
        new Timestamp(taco.getCreatedAt().getTime())));

      final KeyHolder kh =
        new GeneratedKeyHolder();
      this.jdbc.update(psc, kh);
      return keyHolder.getKey().longValue();
    }
  }
~~~

The code is hard to read, and it still requires quite an amount of boilerplate for just an operation.

### Spring Data JPA
_Spring Data JPA_ **is not** a _JPA Provider_. It allows us to automatically create repositories removing the most boilerplate possible, as opposed to using only a JPA Provider _(Hibernate)_. **It adds an extra layer of abstraction on top of it.**  

It's comprised of several subsprojects
* Spring data JPA - JPA persistence to a relational database
* Spring Data MongoDB - against a Mongo document DBB
* Spring Data Redis - against a Redis key-value store  
_(etc)_  

#### Annotations
A JPA entity needs the tags `@Entity` and `@Id`.  
Then, `@GeneratedValue` marks we rely on the database to generate the id.  
`@ManyToMany` indicates relationship between Entities.  
`@PrePersist` calls a method just before it's persisted.  
`@Table` specifies the database table name where our object's information will be saved.

~~~ java
@Entity
@Table(name="TacoCustom")
public class Taco {

  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
  private Long id;

  private Date createdAt;

  // ...

  @ManyToMany(targetEntity = Ingredient.class)
  @Size(min = 1,
  message = "Must select at least 1 ingredient")
  private List<Ingredient> ingredients;

  @PrePersist
  private void createdAt() {
      this.createdAt =
        Date.valueOf(LocalDate.now());
  }

}
~~~

#### Repository
The main advantage of using Spring JPA vs JDBC, is we don't need to implement repositories' methods. We just create an interface, which extends `CrudRepository<Object,ID>` and Spring will write the implementation at runtime.  

This is the whole implementation for a `Taco` repository and we may use directly its parent's methods.

~~~ java
  public interface TacoRepository
    extends CrudRepository<Taco, Long> {

    List<Taco> findAllByCreatedAt(
      final Date createdAt);

  }
~~~

##### Repository methods  
Spring is able to parse the name of the previous method, to generate the SQL statement, which will retrieve the info we need. Another example of this would be

~~~ java
List<Order> findByDeliveryZipAndPlacedAtBetween(deliveryZip,
 date1, date2);
~~~

There's a list of valid operators at _page 82_.

The alternative to this for larger queries would be to use `@Query` tag which **may** use `SQL`
~~~ java
@Query("Order o WHERE o.deliveryCity='Atlanta'")
List<Order> findWhatever();
~~~

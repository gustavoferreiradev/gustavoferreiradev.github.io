JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Created by Facebook.

## Yarn
JavaScript package manager compatible with `npm` that helps automate the process of installing, updating, configuring, and removing npm packages.  

### Install on Ubuntu  
~~~ bash
# add Yarn repository
curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -  

echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list  

sudo apt-get update  
sudo apt-get install yarn  
yarn --version # verify

### Create React Project
* `yarn create react-app my-react-app-name` creates a template
* `yarn start` starts the development server
* `yarn build` bundles the app into static files for prod
* `yarn test`  starts the test runner

## React Components  
They let you split the UI into dependant, reusable pieces. They must always start with a capital letter. Components may refer to other components in their output.  

Try to split them into standalone units, as small as possible, as this does code more reusable in larger apps.

Declaration as a `.jsx` file
~~~ js
class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  }
}

export default HelloWorld
~~~

`render()` returns what needs to be displayed as part of the component.

`export default HelloWorld` Each JS file is a module. If you want elements from one module to be used in another, you need to export them.

Usage of our custom component
~~~ js
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
          <HelloWorld/>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
~~~

### Important Methods  
`componentDidMount()` React defines a lifecycle for its components. This method will be called as soon as the component is mounted.

## Formik
React component to build forms  

### Formik does not (re)load a parameter
Check if at `<Formik>` tag the following flag has been enabled `enableReinitialize={true}`. The reason is that the `render()` method may render it once empty, and the second time it wouldn't load.

The start tag should look as follows  

~~~ js
<Formik
    enableReinitialize={true}
    initialValues={{
        id: id,
        description: description
    }}>
~~~

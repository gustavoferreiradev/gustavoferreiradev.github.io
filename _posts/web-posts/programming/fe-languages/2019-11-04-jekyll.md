[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is a blog-aware static site generator, written in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). It's used for [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and it transforms files written in _markdown_ and _liquid_ into a full HTML web.

## Installation
Pre-requirements

~~~ bash
sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zliblg-dev
sudo gem install jekyll bundler
~~~

<!--more-->

## Configuration
The basic config is under `_config.yml`  

~~~ bash
# shows any config mishap
bundle exec jekyll doctor
~~~

## Usage  
If you do changes to your files, it will automatically generate the site. This is useful to see how it will look when deployed.

~~~ bash
# creates a myBlog folder with all to start
# use this only the first time
sudo jekyll new myBlog

# inside this folder, starts web server at localhost:4000
sudo bundle exec jekyll serve
~~~

### Update Ruby Gems
Change the new Gem version at `Gemfile`. Run `bundle install`   
This will update `Gemfile.lock` with the new versions to use.

You may also specify at `Gemfile` to use any versions greater than _x_ and it will take the newest version if there's any greater. This is done with `bundle update`.

~~~ ruby
gem 'jekyll-sitemap', '~> 1.3.1'
~~~

### Github Pages
Just edit the `.md` files, do a master push and it will be automatically reloaded.

## Posts
### Post example
It will be automatically rendered. The code between `---` tags is metadata for jekyll.

    Oh no! This is a new post.

### tags vs categories
The difference is a category can be a part of the URL whereas a Tag cannot.

### Drafts
Drafts are posts without a date in the filename. They are posts you are still working on and do not want to be published yet. They go under `_draft`.  

To render them, add the `--drafts` flag to `jekyll serve` command.

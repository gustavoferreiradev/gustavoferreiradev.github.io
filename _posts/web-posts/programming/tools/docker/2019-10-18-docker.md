[_Working docker-compose and DockerFile examples to complement this information_](https://github.com/MarioCodes/docker-compose-examples)  
[_Interesting tool to analyze custom Image layers size_](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive)

## Basic Definitions
**Image** Executable package that includes everything needed to run an application. It consists of _read-only_ layers, each of which represent a _DockerFile_ instruction. The layers are stacked and each one is a delta of changes from the previous layer.   
**Container** Instance of an image.

**Stack** Defines the interaction of all the services  
**Services** Image for a microservice which defines how containers behave in production

**DockerFile**  File with instructions that allows us to build upon an already existing image. It defines:
* the base image to build from
* our own files to use or append
* the commands to run  

At the end, a _DockerFile_ will form a service, which we may call from _docker-compose_ or standalone with `docker build`.

**DockerFiles vs docker-compose**
A _DockerFile_ is used when managing a single individual container. _docker-compose_ is used to manage an application, which may be formed by one or more _DockerFiles_. _Docker-compose_ may also be used as support to input large customization options, which otherwise would be parameters in a really long command.  

You can do everything _docker-compose_ does with just docker commands and a lot of shell scripting

<!--more-->

**Volumes** They are the preferred mechanism to persist data, as docker manages them itself, they do not increment the size of the container using them and the contents of the volume exist outside of the life cicle of a container. They're not suitable to write temporal information.

### clusters and stacks (advanced)
**docker-swarm** is the cluster manager embedded in _Docker_. It manages containers running on multipe hosts and does things like scaling, restart a container when it crashes, networking etc.  
**kubernetes** Developed by google. It has similar goals to _DockerSwarm_.

**swarm** multiple _Docker_ hosts which run in _swarm mode_ and act as managers and / or workers. When the user defines a service, it defines its desired state. This is opposed to a _standalone container_.  
**swarm vs standalone containers** One of _swarm_ main advantages, is the possibility to modify a service's config. including network and volumes in real-time without restarting the service. When _Docker_ is running in swarm mode, it's still possible to run a standalone container. The key difference is only _swarm managers_ can manage a _swarm_, while _standalone containers_ can be started on any daemon.  
In the same way that it's possible to run containers with _docker-compose_, it's also possible to define and run _swarm service stacks_.

**node** instance of the _docker engine_ participating in the swarm. To deploy an application to a swarm, a _service definition_ is submitted to a **manager node**. This _manager node_ then dispatches units of work called _tasks_ to **worker nodes**. This _manager node_ also runs all cluster management functions.

**service** _(in swarm)_ is the image for a microservice, which will run as a part of a bigger application on any node. It's the central structure of the swarm system and the root of user interaction with the swarm.  
**task** it carries a _docker container_ and the commands to run inside this container. It's the atomic scheduling unit of swarm. _Manager nodes_ assign tasks to _worker nodes_ according to the number of replicas set. Once a _task_ is assigned to a node, it can only be run there of fail, but it cannot be moved to another node.  

## Installation
### Check if correctly installed
~~~ bash
docker version
docker run hello-world
~~~

### Run without sudo
It's needed to add your user to the docker group  

~~~ bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo gpasswd -a {$USER} docker
# log-out of your user and -in again
~~~

## Docker (local)
### DockerFile  
Example `DockerFile` for a custom python web-app. The commands to run and the needs of every image will be unique. Check at the official image doc. At best is to write a `docker-compose.yml` file to set all the parameters. This way we avoid a reaaally long _start command_.

~~~ bash
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.7.4-alpine3.10

# Set the working directory to /app, to be able to use relative paths from now on from now on
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
ADD . .

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --trusted-host pypi.python.org -r app/requirements.txt

# Declare the intention to export port 80 to the world. Needed to map it on compose File.
EXPOSE 80

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app/app.py"]

~~~

##### How-to run them. Examples
Examples ready with the real, binded parameters the apps need. Only run once and from then on just start the container.
~~~ bash
# Mongo container with a persisted volume binded to mongo folder and maps the port
docker run -d --name mongo_admin --mount source=mongo_admin,target=/data/db -p 27017:27017 mongoclient/mongoclient:latest
~~~
~~~ bash
# Portainer
docker run -dp 9000:9000 -v "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock" --name 'portainer' portainer/portainer
~~~

Create and specify a volume for a container to use

~~~ bash
# Create a volume named "ohno"
docker volume create ohno
# Creates a container from an image, in interactive mode, which will have access
#   to the "ohno" volume every time it's started.
docker run -it --name=volumetest --mount source=ohno,target=/app ubuntu:latest
~~~

### Docker compose  
Example `docker-compose.yml` with two services. `MySQL` and a `Mongo` database. One of them is specified locally on a custom `DockerFile` and the other uses a published image.  

It specifies all the information that otherwise would be on our `docker run` command.
~~~ yml
version: '3.7'
services:

  project-custom-mysql:
    build:
      context: ./mysql-service
      dockerfile: ./DockerFile
    image: project.mysql
    container_name: project.mysql
    command: mysqld --user=root --verbose
    volumes:
      - ./data/mysql:/var/lib/mysql
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE: "project"
      MYSQL_USER: "project_user"
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: "project_pass"
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: "root"
      MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD: "yes"

  project-mongo:
    image: mongo:latest
    container_name: project.mongo
    command: mongod --smallfiles --logpath=/dev/null
    volumes:
      - ./data/mongo:/data/db
    ports:
      - 27017:27017
    environment:
      - MONGO_DATA_DIR=/data/db
      - MONGO_LOG_DIR=/dev/null

~~~

#### Run interactive shell on a single service
Get into the `docker-compose.yml` folder and run the following commands.  
~~~ bash
docker-compose run -d {$SERVICE_NAME}
docker exec -it {$CONTAINER_NAME} /bin/bash
~~~

### Versions and Tags
One way to control versions and give it to builds on _docker-compose_ is doing it at `docker-compose.yml` file on `image`.  

This is an example of a versioned image. If we want to change the version number before deploying, we just need to change it at this file and build again.

~~~ yml  
version: '3.7'
services:
  website:
    build:
      context: ./website
      dockerfile: ./DockerFile
    image: personal-website:0.0.1
    container_name: personal-website
    ports:
      - 4000:4000
~~~

After doing this, we may set _Tags_ to specific _versions_. For example, we want to build the previous version and assign to it `latest` tag.  

~~~ bash
docker tag personal-website:0.0.1 personal-website:latest
~~~

## DockerHub (Remote)  
Online platform to deploy to and get built images from. We may deploy our images there, and we just have to pull them at our _prod_ environment.

### Third-party repositories
* `docker search {$thing_to_search}` explore hub repositories
* `docker pull {$thing}:latest` download it

### Own repositories  
Example on how to build my own image and push to my own _DockerHub_.  
~~~ bash
docker login -u mariocodes
docker-compose build --compress --force-rm --no-cache

docker tag mariocodes/personal-website:version-number mariocodes/personal-website:latest

docker push mariocodes/personal-website:version-number

docker push mariocodes/personal-website:latest
~~~

Then it's possible to directly download and run this image from another environment.

~~~ bash
docker run mariocodes/personal-website:latest
~~~

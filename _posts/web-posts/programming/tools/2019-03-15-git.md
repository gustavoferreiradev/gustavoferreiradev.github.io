## Git bisect  
Is a tool to find the exact commit where a bug was introduced.  

### Usage
I have a file with the following content and an obvious bug  
~~~
Row row row your car at the river
~~~
<!--more-->
This is the git history  
* master - `added word river`  
* `changed word boat for cat`  
* `added word the`  
* `added word at`  
* `added word boat`  
* `added word your`  
* `added third row`  
* `added second row`  
* `added word row`  
* `Initial commit`

We need to select a good and a bad commit. We'll select the last one as bad because the bug is there, and as good the first one.

~~~ bash
git bisect good 6f47e638a6bc5f4210218d77f1c43e34cc16470c  
git bisect bad 8a2d118528471d48d87942b8097093dd04476b25
~~~  

Then it's going to navigate the commit history, changing the actual commit, and we have to check the file and indicate if it's still good or it already contains the bug. We do so with  

~~~ bash  
git bisect good
git bisect bad
~~~

At the end of all, it tell us the exact commit where the bug was introduced  
~~~ bash  
cff142cdac62f6845d69ea4694c4c5e6606f2294 is the first bad commit
commit cff142cdac62f6845d69ea4694c4c5e6606f2294

Date:   Mon Jul 8 16:06:33 2019 +0200

    changed word boat for car
~~~

And we have to exit it with  
~~~ bash
git bisect reset
~~~

### General, useful things
`curl cheat.sh/command_to_search` shows a cheatsheet with options for this command  

### Processing files and data
* `find . -iname "*file_to_search*"` search something at current directory  
* `locate file_to_search` search through whole computer
* `rg` general searching through data files. Better than `grep -r`
* `diff -y --suppress-common-lines file1 file2 | grep '^' | wc -l` count number of changes between 2 files

#### Analyze logs in real time
With `less +F` we can inspect the file, stop to read and resume in real time.
The advantage over `tail -f` is, with the former we can inspect the logs, but if there's an error or something we want to stop and see, we have to exit and `cat` or `vim` the file.  
~~~ bash
less +F file_to_inspect # real time
ctrl + c # stops
shift + F # resumes
~~~

### Discard normal & error output of a command
`> /dev/null` Redirects standard output to /dev/null  
`2>&1` redirects error output to same as standard output
~~~ bash
command_to_execute > /dev/null 2>&1
~~~

#### Vimdiff  
Useful to compare changes between up to 4 files at once. It uses the same commands as vim.  

`ctrl + w` `direction arrow` moves the cursor in between file windows  
`:qa` quit all windows without saving  
`:wqa` same but saving  

### Awk  
Language processor. Useful to process `.csv` or files which are structured by columns. By default, it separates columns **by whitespaces**.  

#### Change line-separator
`awk -F '\t' '{print}' file.txt` Uses **tabs** instead of spaces as separator.

#### Working with filters  
`awk '$19 == "S"' file.txt` show lines where the column #19 is equal to _S_
`awk -F '\t' '$2 == "18249"' file.txt` uses both a filter and another line separator at the same time

`awk '{print $4}' file.txt | sort | uniq` print duplicates entries only once  
`awk -F '\t' '$2 == "18249" || $2 == "18258"' file.txt` one condition **or** the other

#### Working with columns
`awk '{print $4}' file.txt` Prints only column #4  
`awk '{print NR, $4}' file.txt` Print only column #4 with line number  
`awk 'length($2) > 0' file.txt` print lines, where the second column has a length greater than 0.  

#### Regex
`awk '$2 ~ /^[0-9]+$/' fichero.txt` get columns for which the following regex is true  
`!~` regex negation  

### Misc.  
`file_or_command | tee filename` It takes an input, outputs it into the console and at the same time saves it into a file.

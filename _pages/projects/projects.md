# Personal Blog  
![personal-blog-image](/assets/images/personal-blog-image.png)

### Why
I've been writing since the start of my career little notes and _how-to's_ in Markdown so that I don't need to learn a thing twice for the first time. After some time, that collection really grew and I needed a way to be able to find and access my information faster.

### Main Technologies
* Jekyll, Thymeleaf, Markdown  
* Ruby    
* HTML / SASS / JS

I'm currently working on a _Dockerization_ for this web and trying to _self-host_ instead of having to depend on _Github Pages_.
